This is a basic Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. 
The project is designed to replicate the visual layout and key sections of the Amazon website,
including a responsive header with a search bar and cart icon, product listings, and a footer. 
It was created for learning purposes to improve front-end development skills and understand responsive web design.
Feel free to explore, modify, or build upon it.
